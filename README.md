# get next line
The aim of this project is to program a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor. This makes it easy to read text from a file as opposed to reading an arbitrary amount of characters using **read()** function.

## Learned concepts
This project introduces the idea of using static variable to store the last position of the reading performed.
